Here are brief descriptions of the two programs:

The RouletteSim program allows the user to simulate or play roulette spins, with different bets being available for the game mode.

The HorseRace program simulates a horse race between three horses with different odds to win in console ( but can be easily changed to accept user input and etcetera ).
